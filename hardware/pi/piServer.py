"""
This server sends out a datastream in json format contaning information from our
sensors, so it has to three tasks:
    1. Retrive data from arduino/sensors
    2. Package it up
    3. Send data for webapp to pickup

The server is build on the flask platform and is intended to be hosted on a
raspberry pi for ease of interactivity with the digital and physical world 
through it's GPIO pins.

Right now it works so that if you go to server/sensorname it returns a json
object saying if it's activated or not and follow this format
{
    sensor: name,
    status: true/false
}
